        Located in the posterior hypothalamus near
        the wall of the third ventricle is an area
        called the primary motor center for shivering.
        This area is normally inhibited by signals from
        the heat center in the anterior hypothalamic-
        preoptic area but is excited by cold signals
        from the skin and spinal cord.
